This project contains a bash script for Transmission bittorrent client.

The script created will set alternate speed ON/OFF according to the number of
clients in the network.

Be sure you have required programs (transmission-remote, transmission, grep,
nmap) and your user can run them. The script is suppossed to be run
periodically, every few minutes (2-3) so it should be combined with a schedule
tool like cron. Execute 'crontab -e' and add the next line with your full path
